        <h1>The Nostalgia of the Old Internet and Low Tech – Part 1</h1>

        <p>Often I find myself being overwhelmed by how much the Internet and tech have creeped into my life. The
            millennials, and even the weird category I fall into (born too late for the advent of the Internet, but
            early enough with Internet and tech access to have seen the old Internet), share this nostalgia with me. A
            time when websites were not corporate-designed, extremely polished slops, and blogging was still a thing.
            People still blog, and you are most likely reading this on my website, on my blog, but it is rare now. How
            many of your friends own their websites, their place on the net where they can just be themselves – raw,
            open and producing content which requires more than 15 seconds of your attention span? Hardly any.</p>

        <p>I remember being 14 or 15 and going on some forums online and engaging with them. All of them were niche,
            hobby-related forums. Entire websites were dedicated to helping people with a very specific hobby or
            interest. I also remember regularly checking my RSS feed for some blogs that I used to like. And how did I
            happen upon these blogs – by visiting someone&rsquo;s blog site or website. It used to be random stuff on
            there – their thoughts on the latest Android, their weekend trip to somewhere, some cycling stuff that I
            used to follow, dog-training experiences, etc.</p>

        <p>And did it have any like counters? No. No one cared how many people like your stuff, your production, your
            content on the internet. They used to have a hit counter. They could see how many people are reading your
            blogs, but nothing about likes or the plethora of reactions that you see on Facebook and WhatsApp. Some of
            the more advanced blogs had a comment section, which was mostly used by real people commenting in a
            generally positive or at least neutral tone.</p>

        <p>And trust me, I am not in favour of going prehistoric and ditching social media altogether. But do you
            remember when Instagram was a photo-sharing app with a chronological feed that used to say &ldquo;You have
            all caught up&rdquo; after scrolling for a bit? The only videos were IGTV or short videos, but that was
            usually not someone&rsquo;s main content. You used to find a couple of such videos amongst a majority of
            photos.</p>

        <p>And that brings me to the photos themselves – they used to be real. I distinctly remember posting a photo
            about my new gym gloves (I was 16) with the caption &ldquo;No more calloused hands&rdquo;, and another post
            just after that about a new flavour of whey protein supplement that I bought. 20–30 likes used to be a lot
            back then, but I knew the people liking it weren&rsquo;t addicted to double-tapping every post they saw.
            Comments were real and non-generic, unlike today&rsquo;s combination and repetition of emojis or American
            slang.</p>

        <p>The feed was less algorithmic (using a tech-illiterate term here; everything is algorithmic in one way or
            another) and more raw. I was not forced to see content from people or &lsquo;creators&rsquo; that I had no
            clue existed. I only saw stuff from people that I followed.</p>

        <p>I also remember Facebook similarly. Facebook, in some ways, has still kept its soul alive (somehow, or is it
            the people?). Or maybe I just don&rsquo;t use it enough to tell, who knows.</p>

        <p>What I am trying to say is, the internet has been capitalised. And I do not necessarily mean in terms of
            money, but in terms of attention, in terms of focus and insecurity. I do not want to see creators on my
            feed; I want to see my friends. I still want to be able to &lsquo;browse&rsquo; the internet and come across
            people&rsquo;s places – their websites – where they share what they like. I wish that to happen outside of
            the conventional social media platforms. I want websites to feel less like modern web apps. No, I do not
            hate animations, but I also want things to be simpler and to the point. I want information about your
            product, not scroll 5–6 times down to see a bunch of images fly together and produce an animation that is
            utterly useless.</p>

        <p>I want to be able to go to a restaurant and not have to scan a QR code to view the menu on my phone. I go to
            restaurants with my friends and family to escape just that – my digital life. I want a paper menu and to
            talk to real people to order and pay in cash.</p>

        <p>And that last bit brings me to UPI. India has revolutionised digital payments in the country using the
            Unified Payments Interface. I can scan a QR code to pay in real time directly from my bank account to
            anyone – friends, businesses, everyone. You will hardly find any vendor in India that does not accept QR
            code payments. And a lot of them prefer that you pay them via UPI, as they do not have to deal with cash
            and change. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong – UPI is great, and convenient. But it also directly translates to me
            having to have my phone with me everywhere I go. I cannot just go for groceries or shopping without my
            phone. Yes, people still take cash, but they do not prefer it, and I get a second look when I am at the
            payment counter and make the cashier hold my cash and count the change instead of scanning the conveniently
            placed QR code on their desk.</p>

        <p>India has a weird obsession with tech. We adopt tech too quickly and too efficiently. The cashier also wants
            me to give them my phone number so they can produce the bill. &ldquo;It is the system, sir&rdquo;, they say.
            They want me to give them my phone number so that they can conveniently sign me up for unlimited texts about
            offers, discounts, sales, and a membership programme which would save me some &#8377; on my next purchase.
        </p>

        <p>I usually ask them to give me my bill offline, but they insist strongly, saying it is not possible –
            &ldquo;It is the system, sir&rdquo;, they say. I know they are usually lying, so I just say, &ldquo;Alright
            then, I do not want to purchase my items anymore&rdquo;. That sentence magically changes their system so it
            suddenly accepts offline billings without my phone number.</p>

        <p>So what I am trying to say in this passive-aggressive short rant (read blog) is that living like the old
            days, without tech governing every aspect of society, is still possible, but no longer convenient. Arguing with
            the cashier, avoiding reels when I just want to see what my friends and acquaintances are up to, and using
            cash to pay for my cabs are extra steps I need to take to do the things I used to be able to do just 8–10
            years ago.</p>

        <p>I just wish social media went back to the time before we were all attention-and-like whores on the internet.
            I wish to be able to step out conveniently without my phone.</p>

        <p>I have not included a lot of other &lsquo;old-internet&rsquo; and &lsquo;pre-tech society&rsquo; nostalgia
            here, or this would have been a really long rant (read blog). Perhaps I will rant a part 2 someday.</p>
