        <h1>"I Don't Have Anything to Hide" — The Dangerous Myth</h1>

        <blockquote>
            "So what if they see my chats? I don't have anything to hide."
        </blockquote>

        <p>Apple was recently forced by the UK government to provide access to the encrypted data of Apple users—only in
            unencrypted form. Under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), firms are compelled to provide law enforcement
            agencies with data access. And to make matters worse, Apple cannot make this demand public (by law).</p>

        <p>About 7000 miles away in India, the Indian government is playing a similar game. They introduced a bill which
            allows the Tax Authorities to have unchecked access to a citizen's virtual space, which comprises of:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Email servers</li>
            <li>Social media accounts</li>
            <li>Online investment account, trading account, banking account, etc.</li>
            <li>Any website used for storing details of ownership of any asset</li>
            <li>Remote server or cloud servers</li>
            <li>Digital application platforms</li>
            <li>Any other space of similar nature</li>
        </ul>

        <p>How exactly this access will be granted is unclear at the moment since it's just a bill and has yet to be
            passed by parliament.</p>

        <p>I can add Sweden and France to this list too.</p>

        <h2>Surveillance: Then vs. Now</h2>

        <p>The government snooping on your data to monitor your activities isn't a modern digital trend. Back in the
            day, surveillance was offline — intercepting mail, running complex spy networks in communities, and good
            old-fashioned espionage.</p>

        <p>But back then, we also didn't have much to hide. Our photos were printed and stored in albums on our
            bookshelves or tucked away in an almirah. Conversations were in person or over the telephone. Fewer photos,
            fewer calls. Life was simpler and less digital.</p>

        <p>Contrast that to now, and we click a staggering number of photos of our lives, documenting every bit of it -
            from our study table setup to our breakfast, our children, families and their everyday lives, our commute to
            the university or workplace. But we don't go to the shops to get these printed and stored in an album; we
            store them on our phones before uploading them to the cloud.</p>

        <p>Same with our messages—we chat a lot, send photos and videos that we click, send memes, and share our
            location. We are connected all the time. Someone in our contact list almost always knows where we are and
            what we're up to.</p>

        <p>We are <span class="highlight">severely online</span>. And with the advent of even more sophisticated and
            capable AI tools, we can be easily studied and analysed through our online presence. AI is not just being
            used to develop increasingly interesting and capable chat tools and image generators; this same research
            also contributes to making better tools to automate the analysis of your surveillance data that the
            government has (or soon will have) access to.</p>

        <p>Despite this, whenever I bring this up with my family or friends (which include my 20-year-old Gen-Z, always
            online sister and my 25-year-old IT analyst friend), they are surprisingly nonchalant about it.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "What could go wrong even if they see my emails and messages?" says my IT analyst friend.<br>
            "It's not like I have anything to hide; let them see, who cares?" says my sister.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Mind you, these are not my 52-year-old parents or my 86-year-old grandma (who's a devoted user of WhatsApp
            and Facebook on her Xiaomi Android phone). These are young people who you would expect to understand this
            dystopian scenario better.</p>

        <p>I had to explain to them for a good 15-30 minutes what exactly it means, why it is dangerous, and why you
            should care. At the end of the conversation, they seemed a bit more scared than they were (which was none).
            And if I am able to instil this fear in them, I consider that an absolute win.</p>

        <p>I wanted to write this out for others to read (and honestly, to have something to share instead of repeating
            my 30-minute TED Talk).</p>

        <h2>The Boiling Frog</h2>

        <p>Let us start with the basics and ponder a question: Did the surveillance landscape of China become what it is
            in a single day? Or was it a gradual process of increasing surveillance over a span of years by making the
            public used to the increasing dosage of the toxic injection of surveillance?</p>

        <p>It's the classic boiling frog scenario. If you put a frog in a pan of boiling water, it will immediately jump
            out. But if you put the frog in a pan of room-temperature water and slowly, very slowly, start to boil it,
            the frog will adapt to the new temperature until it gets cooked.</p>

        <p>Any regime does not immediately reach its dystopian extremism. It is a very gradual process of making the
            people resistant to extremist ideas, philosophies and surveillance day by day, and by masquerading it as an
            essential thing to do to ensure purity (Hitler) or, in the modern case, to ensure safety from terrorism.</p>

        <p>What starts as a "This tweet or post encourages extremist and anti-national ideas" gradually turns to <span
                class="highlight">"How dare you post this about the government?"</span>.</p>

        <p>I will walk you through the whole scenario of what happens and what it will lead to if left unchecked.</p>

        <h2>The Photo Search Story</h2>

        <p>You store your photos on Google Photos because you find it convenient, as it comes pre-installed with your
            Android phone. All your photos and videos are on there, and the best part is that you get access to a
            plethora of features that make your life easier and solve problems that you would not have actually thought
            you had had you not been given the solutions to them.</p>

        <p>For instance, you want to search for that red shirt you wore in November 2023 at a Diwali party. You open up
            Google Photos and search for either 'Red shirt', 'Diwali November 2023' or a combination of those words. And
            voila, Google Photos immediately presents you with all those photos. You get satisfied with the results and
            get on with your day.</p>

        <p>But what actually happened here is a bit more scarier. Google knows that it is a red shirt, not because you
            told it so or because it is obvious. It is obvious to a human, but to a piece of software, it is just random
            bits of information.</p>

        <p>It went pixel-by-pixel through each of your photos that you stored in it, analysed them, made sense of them,
            recognised faces, clustered them, recognised objects, clustered them, and used excellent natural language
            processing to convert your search term to these image results. But here is where the twist is - all of this
            did not happen on your extremely lightweight, inexpensive Android phone while you were also using it to do
            other stuff. It happened in the cloud, specifically in Google's cloud. Their servers had full access to your
            data, unencrypted, and they processed your personal images in most likely another country and then used that
            information that they learned from them to train their AI models to do the same to other's photos and videos
            across the world.</p>

        <p>This is just one example of what happens when you use these services every day. But the question remains -
            what does it matter? And why should I care about the government seeing it if Google can access my data? I
            will answer those questions; hang on with me.</p>

        <h2>Perfectly Targeted Ads</h2>

        <p>I will now present you with another scenario within the same scary domain. You use Instagram every day. Those
            fascinating reels need to be seen, right? You do not realise that you scrolled the equivalent of 150 metres
            in a single reel-viewing session while liking and commenting on the ones that you found interesting. But
            what you do not pay conscious attention to is the ads that show up between these reels. These ads stop you
            and make you look. Why are they so perfectly targeted?</p>

        <p>Because Meta knows. They know what you like, what you searched for on Google, what you want to buy on Amazon,
            etc. Meta profiles you. It knows who you are because every social media platform that you use (except for X,
            or do you still call it Twitter?) is owned by them. The chats on WhatsApp with your friends are told to be
            end-to-end encrypted by Meta, but we cannot verify this. Neither can we know if there is some new way of
            extracting other information from our chats' metadata that we do not, and will never know about because the
            code for WhatsApp is closed-source. We can't verify their claims of encryption or tracking.</p>

        <h2>Where Does the Government Come In?</h2>

        <p>I have barely touched the tip of the iceberg of tracking, which happens in our everyday lives using the two
            most popular tools (or services). But without giving you another scenario to explain this, I want to link it
            with the big question we wanted to answer: Where does this link up to the governments, and why does it
            matter to me?</p>

        <p>As we saw in the opening lines of this post, Apple, a multi-trillion dollar behemoth with immense power and
            influence around the world, which can fu*k up the UK if they decide to brick the Phones in this country,
            were forced by the British government to bow down and end the end-to-end encryption and possibly allowing a
            backdoor their devices here (we don't know yet!). Similarly, nothing stops the British, Indian or any other
            government, for that matter, from doing the same to Meta, Google, etc.</p>

        <p>They can force them to introduce backdoors and give them access to your online profile, activity, likes and
            dislikes, and political affiliations - yeah, they know that as well based on your interactions with the
            political posts in your feed. How else did you think you got a similar ideology content recommended to you?
            And the worrying, or rather menacingly scary, part is that we might not even know if the governments have
            actually done it, and we just don't know about it. You have no idea what goes on behind those closed doors.
            And you never will.</p>

        <h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>

        <p>One question remains—"Even if they know all of this, why should I care? I do not have anything illegal on my
            phone, on the cloud under my account, or on my social profiles."</p>

        <p>Here is the part that takes time to convince my friends and other people I talk to about this. They won't
            start by dragging you into a dark cell because you favour the opposition and made memes on the sitting Chief
            Minister, the Police commissioner or the Prime Minister. But they eventually will.</p>

        <p>Remember the India's Got Latent incident? An online show with an entirely online presence on YouTube got
            banned, and the people were arrested, questioned and harassed for a harmless joke. The joke was absolutely
            in poor taste, but the incident did not call for such stringent action. Were you able to stop it? Were those
            people on the show (one of whom won an award from the Indian PM) able to do anything to save themselves? No.
            The government and some local governments and protectors of the Indian culture found it offensive and got
            people arrested and harassed legally.</p>

        <p>This is how this starts. Next thing you know, any joke that you make against the CM of West Bengal and share
            online gets the police knocking at your door to arrest you. Oh, wait, that rings a bell. Right! That already
            happens (yes, it happens; it is everyday news in India).</p>

        <p>The government stops your pension as a government employee. You go to Facebook to voice your opinion in a
            rather strongly worded post, and you have an enquiry against you from your department about some random
            stuff from your online profile. This goes on and on, and one day, after around 5-10 years (being generous
            here, honestly), the government also knows that the people of this particular area majorly vote for this
            specific party through their online activity because Google was forced to introduce a backdoor in their
            services that let the government track your political affiliation through your interaction with posts
            online, or your searches.</p>

        <p>Then there is booth capturing by local goons in the next election who force you to vote for a particular
            party through violence and intimidation by storming your gated society and colonies. Wait that rings a bell
            too! You know what I am talking about. As they say in Hindi, "समझदार को इशारा काफ़ी" (A hint to the wise is
            enough to convey the message). We hear such incidents very frequently in India - the biggest democracy in
            the world.</p>

        <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>

        <p>Here is what I need you to understand—all of this will only get worse. We spend more and more time online
            every day, and everything from our purchase history to tickets, photos, maps, locations, messages, posts,
            and shopping is online.</p>

        <p>I am not asking you to stop being online or becoming a caveman and not using the tech that makes our lives
            easier. I only ask you to consider the encrypted, open-source, decentralised alternatives wherever possible.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Use Signal instead of WhatsApp</li>
            <li>Use Ente Photos instead of Google Photos</li>
            <li>Post a bit less on social media</li>
            <li>Keep an eye out for such snooping bills and laws by the government</li>
            <li>Oppose it and educate people around you about it</li>
            <li>Send a letter to your local MP</li>
            <li>Start a petition</li>
            <li>Talk about these things online</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Remember, education and awareness always prevail, and they will help us make more informed choices when we
            vote next.</p>
